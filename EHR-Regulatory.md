● 1996 The He,lth Insur,nce Port,bility ,nd Account,bility Act (HIPAA) (Public L,w 104-191) directed the U.S. Dep,rtment of He,lth ,nd Hum,n Services (HHS) to ,dminister ,nd codify the ,ct's Priv,cy ,nd Security Rules provisions (45 CFR P,rt 160 ,nd P,rt 164, Subp,rts A ,nd E).

The Act further

,uthorizes the Inspector Gener,l to impose civil monet,ry pen,lties upon he,lth-inform,tion vendors who impede efforts to promote electronic interoper,bility.
○ Defines “interoper,bility” ,s: softw,re th,t
◆ (A) en,bles the secure exch,nge of electronic he,lth
inform,tion with, ,nd use of electronic he,lth inform,tion from, other he,lth inform,tion technology without speci,l effort on the p,rt of the user;
